# Pixel_Chess

Decided to make a chess game so I can learn how to use libGdx.

The code for the game logic (it's super messy for now) is in the core folder and the assets are in android/assets

### TODO

- [x] Change ArrayList to HashSet (Better performance)
- [ ] Clean up code
- [x] Fix memory leaks
- [ ] Draw better pieces
- [ ] Flip the board for black's turn (???)
- [ ] Play history
- [ ] Menu
